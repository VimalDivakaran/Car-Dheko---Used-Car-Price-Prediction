# Car-Dheko---Used-Car-Price-Prediction
Description:
The "Car Price Prediction Application" addresses the challenge of providing reliable pricing estimates for used cars. As data can be unstructured and inconsistent, the project focuses on cleaning, encoding, and scaling to ensure data integrity. The final model enables precise pricing predictions to support both car buyers and sellers in the used car market.

Key Highlights:

Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering: Handles unstructured data, extracts meaningful features, and ensures consistency across the dataset.
Optimal Model Selection: Tested multiple models, with Random Forest achieving the best performance:
RÂ² Score: 0.695, explaining over 70% of variance in car prices.

Technologies Used:

Python: Core language for data processing and modeling.
Streamlit: Web framework for building the interactive user interface.
Pandas and NumPy: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
scikit-learn: For model building, tuning, and evaluation.
Pickle: For saving the trained model for deployment.

Business Use Cases:
Used Car Dealerships: Provide data-driven pricing for better customer interactions.
Private Sellers and Buyers: Help individual users make informed pricing decisions.
Market Analysis: Gain insights into factors affecting car prices.
